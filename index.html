              <h2>Casual Ballroom for Beginners</h2>
              <p>Competitions are not for everyone - sometimes you just want to learn how to dance beautifully and get to know other people that enjoy this sport without the stress of having to commit to competing! If that’s the case come try out our social ballroom and latin lessons:</p>

              </p>

              <h2>Ballroom</h2>
              <p>Our classes cover all five dances of international style ballroom. Beginners start with Waltz and Quickstep, and as your experience and skills increase the other dances will start to look less impossible. For dancers of all levels we offer technique classes and private tuition from our professional coaches. If you're interested in dancing competitively, please see our Team page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Waltz</h3>
              <p>One of the compulsory Beginners Team dances. The Waltz originated from Vienna and Austria in the 17th century. Throughout the 18th century a dance called the ‘waltzen’ developed. This dance was introduced at the beginning of the 19th century where it was met with some indignation as it was the first dance that was danced with the man’s hand around the lady’s waist. Fortunately the opposition to the dance dispersed allowing it to develop into what we now know as the Modern Waltz in its characteristic three-beat time.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Quickstep</h3>
              <p>This is the other compulsory Beginners Team ballroom. The Quickstep was originally a fast version of a Foxtrot, developed because many bands in the 1920s played the Foxtrot music too fast. The energy exerted during a 60 second Quickstep is the equivalent to that exerted by running a mile in record time. The Quickstep is the most popular ballroom dance today.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Foxtrot</h3>
              <p>The Foxtrot originated in 1913 from the Vaudeville act of actor Harry Fox. The dance contains a mixture of quick and slow steps and gives much more enjoyment than the one- and two-step that it replaced. It has smooth gliding steps that develop around the ballroom floor throughout the dance.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Tango</h3>
              <p>
                In the early 19th century the Tango was a solo dance performed by women. It originated from Argentina and spread through Europe in the 1900s. The phrasing is very important in Tango; there are major phrases, minor phrases, and Tango closes at the end of the phrase. There are many different types of Tango, however, the style that we dance is the International Tango.

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Viennese Waltz</h3>
              <p>The Viennese Waltz is a much faster version of the Modern Waltz, but has the same origins. There are fewer steps to learn and they are especially versatile for covering the floor, but the speed more than enough makes up for the limited steps. The composers Franz Lanner and Johann Strauss from the 1830s are well noted for their beautiful Viennese Waltz pieces.</p>

              <h2>Latin</h2>
              <p>Our classes cover all five dances of international style latin. Beginners start with the well-known cha-cha and jive. We have medal classes from bronze level up to goldstar, technique classes and Beginners Team classes for those interested in dancing competitively in the university circuit at a national level. If you're interested in dancing competitively, please see our Team page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Samba</h3>
              <p>While keeping elements of what the Brazilians believe is the true Samba, Ballroom Samba was formalized in 1956 by Pierre Lavelle and is what we dance in competitions today. It is made up of many different South American dances incorporated into one. It is very rhythmical with lots of hip action. There should be a good balance of moving steps and stationary steps and lots of outstretched arms. The accomplished dancer is made to look effortless and carefree with knee action, body sway, and "pendulum motion."</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Jive</h3>
              <p>The most noticeable aspects of the Jive are its energy, speed, and bounce, it is one of the fastest dances and should show lots of kicks, flicks, and twirling of the lady. This rhythmical and swinging dance is influenced by the Boogie, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Swing, and Lindy Hop. This dance is usually performed last in competitions owing to the energy required to perform it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Rumba</h3>
              <p>
                The Rumba originates from Cuba and it was first seen in the United States in 1920. It relies on the age-old premise of the lady trying to conquer the man by means of her womanly charms. Incorporating all the elements of teasing and withdrawal, it is considered the most sensual of the Latin dances. Look out for figure-eight hip rolls!

          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Paso Doble</h3>
              <p>The Paso Doble originated from southern France, although it is modeled after the drama and movement of a Spanish bullfight. This is the dance for the Man, he fill the "Space" with strong three-dimensional shapes and movements danced with "Pride and Dignity." The Paso is danced with a high chest and the shoulders wide and down, imitating the bullfight nature of the dance. It is almost always choreographed to ‘Spanish Gypsy Dance’ which has 3 highlights in the music, where dramatic positions are executed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Cha Cha</h3>
              <p>
                This is a cheeky, lively and flirtatious dance, it has a catch-me-if-you-can atmosphere, and is light and bubbly. By the early fifties it had developed from mambo into a dance in its own right and had been given the name ‘Chacha’. The name comes from the sound made by the feet during the 3-step change of weight, cha-cha-cha.
                    After the summer break you should come back and come to our team tryouts so you can all get partnered up again and so we can admire how much you have improved!

              <p>Main team is what all our competitive dancers aim for – it means that you are representing Imperial College Dance club at competitions and upholding our name against other universities with your awesome dancing!!</p>
              <p>Team includes dancers who have just graduated from our beginner team all the way up to extremely advanced. Being on team is a fantastic opportunity. For starters we have coaches of an unbelievable standard at Imperial – we promise that pretty much every word they say will improve your dancing! The other aspect of course is belonging to a team that is practicing hard towards a common goal. You will have seen each other so often and practice so hard together by the end of the season they are bound to feel a bit like family (both in a good and a frustrating way!)</p>

              <p>
                At the beginning of each year tryouts are held to determine partnerships and the dancing level of our dancers. You will be taught a short choreography at the start of the tryout and then asked to dance with various partners.
                ALL LEVELS above beginner are encouraged to attend tryouts! This is an opportunity for the coaches to get to know you and to find the best partner for you. It is not a test!

              <h2 id="competitions">Competitions</h2>
              <p>One of the most exciting aspects of being part of IC Dance Team is competing together as a team. During the first part of the year (September - March), the majority of the university competitions throughout the UK take place, and we traditionally attend four of them. This culminates with the Inter-Varsity Dance Competition (IVDC), held in the beginning of March in Blackpool - the biggest and most important university competition of the year.</p>
              <p>In the second part of the competitive season (March - September), we attend open circuit competitions.  These do not distinguish between students and ex-students as in the university circuit.</p>
              <p>University circuit competitions</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Nottingham Varsity Competition (Nottingham, end of November)</li>

              <h2 id="technique">Technique classes</h2>
              <p>These classes form the backbone of Imperial College Dance!</p>
              <p>The aim of these classes is to work hard on the difficult bits of dancing and improve each individual’s dancing. As the name implies these classes are not for choreography or practicing performance - they are for learning technique that can then be applied to all steps and to any choreography.</p>
              <p>So who are the classes for?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Everyone on main team</li>
                <li>Anybody  hoping to improve their competitive dancing</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Sometimes unfortunate events happen that mean you are not able to commit to dancing main team for a set of competitions or you cannot find a suitable partner for the season…
                This can happen but it is really frustrating when you have to stop dancing because there are no competitive classes available for you without a partner. This is why we have technique classes!
                By coming regularly to these practices you can maintain and improve your individual level of dancing (you don’t need a fixed partner for the lessons) and we hope it can act as a platform for single partners hoping to compete to meet and form new partnerships.

                  You will be expected to commit to attending classes regularly since the aim of these classes is to progress through the year and improve on previous skills learnt. Alos classes as aimed at competitors and are not social classes. If you are looking for social dancing please see our page social ballroom and latin.

              <h2 id="beginnersteam">Beginners Team</h2>
              <p>Are you a beginner and interested in dancing ballroom or latin competitively? Then join our Beginners Team, and be part of one of the most entertaining and rewarding adventures at Imperial!</p>
              <p>
                Starting in October, there are two Beginners
                Team practices every week - during them you will
                be introduced to the competitive aspect of
                dancesport, from the absolute beginner level.
                You will initially learn four dances - two
                ballroom (Waltz and Quickstep) and two latin
                (Cha-cha-cha and Jive).
              </p>
              <p>
                As you progress through the year, you will start learning about the other six dances! In March, the beginners team starts with new routines
                (Other     dances will be taught as you progress to higher levels - see main     team for full list of dances)
              </p>
              <p>You will be paired up with a partner after a couple of weeks and then go to your first competition between Uk universities. We go to 4 university competitions in a year and they are a big deal (more info available under main team)!</p>
              <p>
                Beginners from universities across the UK compete in their own circuit so although it may seem scary you will be competing against people of your same level. Competitions are the best part of dancesport as they are incredibly fun team events as well allowing you to see your fantastic improvement through the year!

                <p>
                  You may be wondering what happens to you after our last competition IVDC…
                  We hope many of you will want to stay on till next year and join either Novice or Intermediate level competitions as part of main team.
                  So what happens during this transition period? MORE DANCING is always the answer.
                  It is a difficult time with many people having exams but putting in the effort to continue dancing now will serve you in good stead for Nottingham competition next year!
                  After the summer break you should come back and come to our team tryouts so you can all get partnered up again and so we can admire how much you have improved!

            <div class="item">
              <h3>Do I need a partner?</h3>
              <p>
                No! At most beginner classes you get rotated around to dance with different partners as this helps avoid getting into bad dance habits. As time goes on or if you decide to compete then you may settle down with one practice partner but there is definitely no need to bring a partner with you to try out the classes! Bring a friend along instead for some extra fun!!
                (If on the other hand you do have a partner you want to dance with it is possible to avoid rotating)

            <div class="item">
              <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
              <p>Comfortable clothes and sports shoes or flats. If you have some shoes that don’t have too much grip that is preferable because that lets you spin better!! If you decide to stick to dance then we can advise you on some dance shoes to buy and where to get them.</p>

              <p>We have several rooms available for practice during the week - you can find them listed on the Timetable. As a dance club, we require a lot more space than most other clubs; the Union exceptionally allows us to book all these rooms under the following conditions:
                <ul>
                  <li>Only practise in rooms that have been officially booked;</li>
                  <li>Leave the rooms as you found them - any furniture you move to clear up space must be replaced at the end of your practice.</li>
                </ul>You are also welcome to practise in rooms where group classes are taking place, as long as this does not disturb the class and there is enough space.
