                Strictly Come Dancing, if the rhythm in songs

                Competitions are not for everyone - sometimes
                you simply want to learn how to dance
                beautifully, do something relaxing for a
                break of your daily schedule, and get to know
                other people without having to commit as much.
                If that’s the case, come  and try out our&nbsp;<a href="#casual">Casual Ballroom and Latin</a>&nbsp;classes!  One of the major aims of these lessons is to teach
                you some of the most important dance skills: leading and

              <h2>Ballroom</h2>
              <p>Our classes cover all five dances of international style ballroom. Beginners start with Waltz and Quickstep, and as your experience and skills increase the other dances will start to look less impossible. For dancers of all levels we offer technique classes and private tuition from our professional coaches. If you're interested in dancing competitively, please see our Team page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Waltz</h3>
              <p>One of the compulsory Beginners Team dances. The Waltz originated from Vienna and Austria in the 17th century. Throughout the 18th century a dance called the ‘waltzen’ developed. This dance was introduced at the beginning of the 19th century where it was met with some indignation as it was the first dance that was danced with the man’s hand around the lady’s waist. Fortunately the opposition to the dance dispersed allowing it to develop into what we now know as the Modern Waltz in its characteristic three-beat time.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Quickstep</h3>
              <p>This is the other compulsory Beginners Team ballroom. The Quickstep was originally a fast version of a Foxtrot, developed because many bands in the 1920s played the Foxtrot music too fast. The energy exerted during a 60 second Quickstep is the equivalent to that exerted by running a mile in record time. The Quickstep is the most popular ballroom dance today.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Foxtrot</h3>
              <p>The Foxtrot originated in 1913 from the Vaudeville act of actor Harry Fox. The dance contains a mixture of quick and slow steps and gives much more enjoyment than the one- and two-step that it replaced. It has smooth gliding steps that develop around the ballroom floor throughout the dance.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Tango</h3>
              <p>
                In the early 19th century the Tango was a solo dance performed by women. It originated from Argentina and spread through Europe in the 1900s. The phrasing is very important in Tango; there are major phrases, minor phrases, and Tango closes at the end of the phrase. There are many different types of Tango, however, the style that we dance is the International Tango.

            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Viennese Waltz</h3>
              <p>The Viennese Waltz is a much faster version of the Modern Waltz, but has the same origins. There are fewer steps to learn and they are especially versatile for covering the floor, but the speed more than enough makes up for the limited steps. The composers Franz Lanner and Johann Strauss from the 1830s are well noted for their beautiful Viennese Waltz pieces.</p>

              <h2>Latin</h2>
              <p>Our classes cover all five dances of international style latin. Beginners start with the well-known cha-cha and jive. We have medal classes from bronze level up to goldstar, technique classes and Beginners Team classes for those interested in dancing competitively in the university circuit at a national level. If you're interested in dancing competitively, please see our Team page.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Samba</h3>
              <p>While keeping elements of what the Brazilians believe is the true Samba, Ballroom Samba was formalized in 1956 by Pierre Lavelle and is what we dance in competitions today. It is made up of many different South American dances incorporated into one. It is very rhythmical with lots of hip action. There should be a good balance of moving steps and stationary steps and lots of outstretched arms. The accomplished dancer is made to look effortless and carefree with knee action, body sway, and "pendulum motion."</p>

              <h3>Jive</h3>
              <p>The most noticeable aspects of the Jive are its energy, speed, and bounce, it is one of the fastest dances and should show lots of kicks, flicks, and twirling of the lady. This rhythmical and swinging dance is influenced by the Boogie, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Swing, and Lindy Hop. This dance is usually performed last in competitions owing to the energy required to perform it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Rumba</h3>
              <p>
                The Rumba originates from Cuba and it was first seen in the United States in 1920. It relies on the age-old premise of the lady trying to conquer the man by means of her womanly charms. Incorporating all the elements of teasing and withdrawal, it is considered the most sensual of the Latin dances. Look out for figure-eight hip rolls!

              <h3>Paso Doble</h3>
              <p>The Paso Doble originated from southern France, although it is modeled after the drama and movement of a Spanish bullfight. This is the dance for the Man, he fill the "Space" with strong three-dimensional shapes and movements danced with "Pride and Dignity." The Paso is danced with a high chest and the shoulders wide and down, imitating the bullfight nature of the dance. It is almost always choreographed to ‘Spanish Gypsy Dance’ which has 3 highlights in the music, where dramatic positions are executed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <h3>Cha-cha-cha</h3>
              <p>This is a cheeky, lively and flirtatious dance, it has a catch-me-if-you-can atmosphere, and is light and bubbly. By the early fifties it had developed from mambo into a dance in its own right and had been given the name ‘Chacha’. The name comes from the sound made by the feet during the 3-step change of weight, cha-cha-cha.</p>

                "I really want to dance, but I don’t want to do
                competitions" you might think. The Ballroom and
                Latin Casual classes are exactly what you are
                looking for - it does not matter if you cannot
                commit to every single lesson or what your level is. These
                classes are for you to socialise with others, to
                enjoy the dance and the music and at the same time
                to learn what you want to learn.  We offer
                Ballroom and Latin lessons for beginners as well
                as intermediate and advanced dancers.

                For those who are completely new to dancing -
                do not worry about what to wear, just turn
                up to the lessons. But if you would like to dance
                more in the future, a pair of Ballroom or Latin dance shoes is
                a great investment!

For those interested in going to competitions, we run classes at three levels: beginners, novice and intermediate/advanced. For beginners, we have the&nbsp;<a href="#beginnersteam">Beginners Team</a>. For more experienced dancers, we have Novice and Int/Adv&nbsp;<a href="#technique">Technique practices</a>.

The Beginners Team and the Main Team together
                form Imperial College Dance Team (ICDT or the

              <p>Are you a beginner and interested in dancing ballroom or latin competitively? Then join our Beginners Team, and be part of one of the most entertaining and rewarding adventures at Imperial!</p>
              <p>
                The Beginners Team is specifically for absolute
                beginners who have little or no prior experience in
                Ballroom or Latin dancing. The classes start in
                October and there are two practices every week.
                You will begin by learning four dances - two
                ballroom (Waltz and Quickstep) and two latin
                (Cha-cha-cha and Jive).
                
              </p>
              <p>
                After the first few weeks, you will be paired up with a partner
                and go to your first competition with the rest of the Team! We usually go to 4 university competitions
                in a year, where teams from different universities compete against each other. The
                beginners dance in their own category, so
                although it may seem scary at first,
                you will be competing against people who
                have the same experience as you.  Competitions
                are one of the most entertaining and challenging parts of the
                Beginners Team - they give you a motivation to
                improve, as well as being amazingly fun team
                trips! (For more info, see the&nbsp;<a href="#competitions">Competitions</a>&nbsp;section).

                the beginning of March, the beginners will
                start learning entirely new routines in those dances.
                This is a perfect time to join the Beginners
                Team if you have missed the beginning of the
                year and don't want to cut in the middle (which
                you are welcome to do if you wish to!).
                Otherwise to join at any time, simply turn up to one
                of the practices - you can find the schedule&nbsp;<a href="#timetable">here</a>.

              <h2 id="technique">Technique practices</h2>
              <p>
                We run four Technique practices every week, each
                one an hour long: Novice Ballroom, Novice Latin,
                Int/Adv Ballroom and Int/Adv Latin.  The aim of
                these classes is to focus on the
                tricky bits of dancing and practice the
                technique of the steps.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Novice classes, you will spend time on
                Waltz, Quickstep, Cha-cha-cha and Jive, and
                you will work on improving aspects or steps that you often
                encounter in a routine, as for example holding
                your frame or spinning. You will also learn to perform
                steps from a third dance in each style that you
                might not be so
                familiar with (such as Tango or Paso Doble).
              </p>
              <p>
                In Int/Adv, the steps are broken
                down much further, and more attention is paid on
                how to move different parts of your body and
                everything as a whole, how to connect with
                your partner, etc. The level of these classes is
                very high, so talk to the coach if you are
                unsure whether to go to Novice or Int/Adv.
                
              </p>
              <p>
                During the Technique practices you will be thus
                learning technique that you can later apply to
                any choreography. They are very useful classes and your
                dancing will improve tremendously if you take
                even a little time to practise what you've
                learned before the next lesson.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technique practices are also very suitable for people who
                really want to dance competitively, but do not
                yet have a partner. Apart from upkeeping and
                improving your dancing, they are meant to act as a
                platform for single dancers to meet other
                dancers of their level.

              <h2 id="mainteam">Main Team</h2>
              <p>
                The Main Team is composed of our most committed
                dancers above the beginner level. Main
                Team couples have two practices a week: one
                Main Team practice (one and a half
                hours on Wednesdays), and one Technique practice
                (one hour, usually on Saturdays).
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Main Team includes dancers who have just
                graduated from the Beginners Team, all the way up
                to the most advanced couples -  to be part of the Main
                Team, what matters is whether you want and are
                ready to commit to regular practice, rather than
                what your level is.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being on the Main Team is a fantastic opportunity. For
                a start, we have coaches of an extremely high
                standard, who truly devote themselves to
                their students. In addition, belonging
                to a team that is practising hard towards a
                common goal is a very fulfilling experience...
                You will have seen each other so often and will
                have practised so hard together that, by the end
                of the season, it will start to feel something
                like... well, a team!
              </p>

                      <p>One of the most exciting aspects of being part of IC Dance Team is competing together as a team. During the first part of the year (September - March), the majority of the university competitions throughout the UK take place, and we traditionally attend four of them. This culminates with the Inter-Varsity Dance Competition (IVDC), held in the beginning of March in Blackpool - the biggest and most important university competition of the year.</p>
                      <p>In the second part of the competitive season (March - September), we attend open circuit competitions.  These do not distinguish between students and ex-students as in the university circuit.</p>

            <div class="item">
              <h3>Do I need a partner?</h3>
              <p>
                For the larger part of our lessons - no!  At all beginner classes you will
                get rotated in order to try out dancing
                with different people. As time goes on
                or if you decide to compete, you may of
                course settle down with one practice
                partner; there is however definitely no
                need to bring a partner with you to try
                out the classes - bring a friend along
                instead for some extra fun!!
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are an experienced dancer looking
                for a partner, the best place to come to
                is one of the Technique practices - you will
                find other people of similar level to yours at
                these classes. However, to be part of the Main
                Team and attend the additional Main Team
                practice, you will need to have a
                partner, as only couples can join it.

              <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
              <p>
                Each class is charged by hour (except Main Team).
                One hour is&nbsp;<strong>£6 for non-members</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>£4 for members.</strong>&nbsp;Further discounts are available for
                those who want to commit to
                dance: if you are a member,
                you can get a bulk buy card of<strong>10 lessons for £35</strong>, which can be used for any of the
                weekly classes!
              </p>
              <p>
                Those who wish to join the Main Team
                are required to purchase a Main Team
                pass for the whole term. The prices are
                set in the beginning of the year - for
                term 3 in 2014, it is&nbsp;<strong>£28 per person, per style</strong>: this includes
                the Wednesday Main Team practice and
                one hour Saturday technique practice for
                all the weeks in the term.

                <ul>
                  <li>Only practise in rooms that have been officially booked;</li>
                  <li>Leave the rooms as you found them - any furniture you move to clear up space must be replaced at the end of your practice.</li>
                </ul>You are also welcome to practise in rooms where group classes are taking place, as long as this does not disturb the class and there is enough space.
